This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a doctor will prescribe a recommended medication based on data from interactions between medical representatives and doctors. The dataset includes various features, such as doctor specialization, type of medication, interaction history, and prescription patterns. By analyzing this data, the project seeks to uncover the key factors that influence prescription decisions and develop an accurate predictive model that can assist in optimizing sales strategies for pharmaceutical companies.
